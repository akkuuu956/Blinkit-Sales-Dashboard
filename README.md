🔍 **Key Insights:**

**1️⃣ Sales by Fat Content:**
• High-fat items are top contributors to total sales — a clear consumer preference.
• However, these items tend to have lower customer ratings, suggesting a trade-off between **popularity and satisfaction**.
• Low-fat items sell less but are **rated higher**, appealing to a **niche health-conscious** market.

**2️⃣ Item Type Performance:**
• Categories like **Dairy and Snacks** are driving major revenue.
• Some item types show **low sales + low ratings** — ideal for optimization or discontinuation.
• High item count but low average sale points to **volume-based, low-margin** inventory.

**3️⃣ Outlet-Level Insights:**
• **Urban outlets** or certain establishment types lead in overall sales.
• Fat content preference varies by outlet, highlighting a **need for geo-based stocking strategies**.

**4️⃣ Customer Satisfaction Trends:**
• Top-rated items are not always top-sellers — opportunity for **strategic promotion**.
• Low-rated, high-selling items may require **quality control or customer guidance**.
• Focused marketing can uplift lesser-known products with great reviews.

**5️⃣ Efficiency Metrics:**
• Average sales per item reveals **high-ticket vs. low-ticket** dynamics.
• Some outlets maintain fewer items but generate higher sales — **inventory efficiency** in action.

📌 **Actionable Recommendations:**

✅ Optimize inventory per outlet based on **fat-content preferences**
✅ Promote high-rated, under-performing products
